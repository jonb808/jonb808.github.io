## Entering Javascript
Starting a new programming language can be a great experience, especially for a newbie like me who is only proficient in Java. 
Completing the codecamp Javascript challenges, I felt that Javascript was quite similar to Java in coding style. The foundational knowledge  of Java's coding style made it easier to understand and code in Javascript. From what I've learned, Javascript and Java languages are similar as they are both object-oriented. However, the two languages are implented differently with Javascript being an interpreted scripting language that can be intepreted directly through a browser. Java on the other hand, is considered a compiled programming language. Overall, I feel like going from Java to Javascript is good practice experience for programming language transitions since they have similar styles for a different focus.
