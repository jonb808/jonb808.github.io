## Overview
At the start of every semester, students may find difficulties finding their new classes. Our solution to this problem is to create a website that will help guide students to these classes. 

## Mockup pages
We will have a register/login page for users to access. Once logged, the page will display current schedule for the user with each class opening up to the respective directions. We will also have a link to an account page with input/edit options to add or make changes to their schedule.

## Case ideas
In the case of a freshmen who is completely unfamiliar with the campus, he/she could easily get lost or be late to their classes. The campus map isn't always specific and is hard to navigate. By using our website, a clear direction to each of his/her classes can be provided with additional details to locate the specific classroom. 

## Beyond the basics
We can add features to locate food trucks, vending machines, and other interesting locations on campus.
