Student Calendar
by: David Cole, Jason Maligon, Jonathan Bach

## Overview
Students' classes and their respected assignments are separated into different lists in Laulima making it inconvenient to keep track. Our idea involves a collective calendar to take the current list of assignments for each course and inserting them into the calendar. We also intend to include customizable notification feature. The problem with this idea at that Laulima needs access that we are unable to directly provide and it is also third-party software. One possible solution to this would be to include a redirect to laulima for the user to enter their login for access. Once the user is logged in, we could then utilize the available link to access the assignment pages. We would then have to find a method to extract the information from the page. Another possible solution or work-around would be to make the calendar separate from laulima as an alternative option for both instructors and students. 

## Mockup page ideas
The main page will be set up as a large calendar with assignments in their respective due dates. As of now, idead for additional pages include a login, profile, and edit page. 

## Case ideas
The purpose of this project would be to make school more manageable for students. Normally, a student will have to keep a planner of some kind to keep track of their assignments. Manually recording and sorting assignments make it easier for students to get disorganized encounter mistakes or moments of carelessness. In the case where a student may have few assignments and with due dates far into the future, it would not be strange for the student to forget about the later assignments until the day before it is due. The calendar would be able to help by providing a clear overview of all upcoming assignments. It would also make it easier for students to account for assignments in other classes when planning a study schedule.
